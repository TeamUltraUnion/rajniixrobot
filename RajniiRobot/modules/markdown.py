Markdown is a very powerful formatting tool supported by telegram.
@{BOT_USERNAME} has some enhancements, to make sure that 
saved messages are correctly parsed, and to allow you to create buttons.

◇ _italic_ : wrapping text with 2 undersores (`_`) will create italic text.

◇ *bold* : wrapping text with Asterisk (`*`) will create bold text.

◇ `code` or `monospace` : wrapping text with acute or 'back tick' (*`*) will produce monospaced text, also known as code.

◇ [Link Text](https://www.google.com/) : wrapping text by `[]` square brackets and url by `()` curvy brakets as
`[Link Text](https://www.google.com/)`.

◇ Inline Button:
